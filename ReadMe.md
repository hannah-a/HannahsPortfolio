My portfolio website showcases all the projects I completed in my DGM 1600 Intro to Web Scripting class. 

I learned how to dynamically add HTML elements through Javascript and call API's databases in order to create a display of Star Wars Characters, Films and Starships. Along with United States Representatives and Magic of the Gathering Cards. 

I learned how to manipulate this data to be visually pleasing by using CSS flexbox to display rows of figures. Each of the figures had unique data inserted dynamically through Javascript.

One challenge I faced with the API's was edge case handling. There were variations of how the API formatted the data that I needed to create try/catch blocks and refactor the data in order for the figures to display uniformally. 

I added many functionalities into my website such as a search bar to search for your state's representatives, a sorting capability to select certain Magic of the Gathering Cards, and error handling that would display a modul telling the user that the Star Wars ship could not be displayed.

My experience on these projects were challenging and gratifying.
